# Deploy pgAdmin on Render

This is a [pgAdmin](https://www.pgadmin.org/) template that can be forked and deployed on [Render](https://render.com). (Or any other service that builds and deploys from A Dockerfile.)

It uses pgAdmins's [pre-built Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/dpage/pgadmin4/) as base.

## Deployment

See the guide at https://www.pgadmin.org/docs/pgadmin4/latest/container_deployment.html.
